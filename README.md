*Estimating the cost of visiting hospital*


## Aim:
The aim of this project is to estimate the cost of visiting hospital outpatient given a constraint on time and budget with patients visiting by car, uber, taxi and public transport.

## Background:
Outpatient visitors serve a substantial portion of our patient demographics. With the requirement for patients to travel to the hospital in order to receive consultation, patients may often have to travel long periods of time to receive care. This variation in travel and constraints results in a shift in patient accessibility to health care in the context of public health and care equity. This in an area of health service that has been investigated minimally. By investigating this neglected area of patient care, we hope to open possibilities for further investigations and analysis of how to improve this side of patient care in outpatient services.
The impacts on patient wellbeing and satisfaction from commuting long periods of time to the hospital are not well appreciated. Our group will be using patient demographic information to analyze the effects of visiting the hospital. This will guide further decisions made to reduce the impact on patients making the journey to the hospital and other measures to maximize patient outcome and satisfaction.


## Project Design:
The project will be carried out in two stages. Firstly, we will make use of a questionnaire in the first stage to serve as a basis of data collection of patient demographics to serve as a guideline to create our web-based application in one hospital. Then, we will use this information to offer recommendations to maximize patient burden. The questionnaire will not have patient identifiers and has been designed to maximize anonymity and patient confidentiality. Based on the amount of patients at Monash Health, we will try and collect more than 200 participants for a large data pool and representation. 
Patients will be approached during in the waiting rooms of clinics and in-patient wards. Written consent will be obtained by the investigator on the team. It should take about five minutes. The inclusion criteria are any patients, family, friends that visit the hospital. The exclusion criteria are participants that have not completed the questionnaire completely.
